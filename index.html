    <h2>Currency Basics</h2>
      <p>The currency of the People's Republic of China is the Renminbi (RMB). The word Renminbi refers to the overall currency, while the Yuan is the denomination of the currency.</p>


    <h2>Exchange Rate Overview</h2>
      <p>In the years prior to 2005, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) fixed the RMB/USD exchange rate. The Renminbi was pegged to the US dollar and only allowed to fluctuate within a very narrow range of 30 basis points (0.003/$).</p>

      <p>On July 21, 2005, the People's Bank of China announced that the exchange rate would float based on market supply and demand, although it would still be a managed exchange rate. The exchange rate would be managed against a basket of currencies whose composition has never been revealed. Daily movement of the exchange rate was initially capped at ±0.3%. Through international pressure (and, theoretically, China's realization of the importance of a free-floating exchange rate), this cap expanded to in May 2007 to ±0.5%, again in April 2012 to ±1.0%, and again in March 2014 to ±2.0%.</p>

      <p>For more on the exchange rate's history and structure, visit our <a href="exchange_rate.html">Exchange Rate</a> page.</p>

    <h2>Capital Controls Overview</h2>
      <p>The term <emph>capital controls</emph> refers to the techniques and policies emplyed by a government in order to restrict the flow of money into or out of the company. As China has maintained tight control over its exchange rate, the government has simultaneously maintained a system of tight capital controls.
